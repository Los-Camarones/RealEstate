        <p>
          I consider myself extremely fortunate to be doing exactly what I want in life. In my case, this means
          working with my family and friends, friends of friends, and other personal referrals to buy and sell real
          estate in the greater Sacramento area, as well as in Sutter, Roseville and Yuba Counties. I lived in Maryville
          and graduated from Lindhurst HS. At 115, I was off to CSU Sacramento where I obtained a Communication Studies
          degree. Coming from an agricultural, migrant background, my parents did not have the means to pay for my college
          education so I put myself through school by working in the fields during summer break and then by working as a
          student assistant. While in college, I experienced my greatest life success. I was able to travel abroad and
          live in Sweden as an international student for one year. One of the most rewarding experiences. I knew then that
          anything was possible. I am very proud to live in a different culture and to be able to adapt so well. The
          highlight of my year abroad was traveling in St. Petersburg, Russia.
          I enjoy being a Realtor because I love working closely with individuals and learning about their goals and
          dreams of homeownership. I am excited to assist individuals in attaining their dream of homeownership. The most
          important thing to know is that I am a professional and I seek education in order to stay current on the ever
          changing Real Estate market. I would never expect to be given your business because of our relationship, or how
          we may know each other. However, if you ever have a real estate need, I would be extremely honored if you
          would give me an opportunity to work for you to earn your business. Thank you so much for taking the time to
          read a little about me, it is appreciated.
