              <li className="mb-5 text-left" >
                <strong>Start saving early:</strong> When calculating how much money you need to buy a house, consider one-time expenses as well as new, recurring bills. Key upfront costs include:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-left">
                  <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> Depending on your mortgage type, down payments can range from as low as 3% to 20% of the home's price.</li>
                  <li><strong>Closing costs:</strong> Typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, which can add up to thousands of dollars.</li>
                  <li><strong>Move-in expenses:</strong> Donâ€™t forget to budget for moving costs and any immediate repairs or furnishings you may need.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2 text-left">
                <strong>Decide how much home you can afford:</strong> Use online calculators to assess your budget based on your income, debt, and credit score.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2 text-left">
                <strong>Check and polish your credit:</strong> Your credit score significantly influences your mortgage eligibility and interest rates. Get free copies of your credit reports, pay bills on time, and keep credit card balances low.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2 text-left">
                <strong>Explore mortgage options:</strong> Familiarize yourself with various types of mortgages, such as FHA loans with low down payment requirements or VA loans with no down payment for veterans.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2 text-left">
                <strong>Research first-time home buyer assistance programs:</strong> Many states offer programs that combine low-interest loans with down payment assistance, making home ownership more accessible.
