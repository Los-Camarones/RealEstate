            <p>
              I consider myself extremely fortunate to be doing exactly what I want to do in life. In my case this means working with my family 
              and friends, friends of my friends, and other personal referrals to buy and sell real estate in the greater Sacramento area, as 
              well as in Sutter, Yolo and Yuba Counties. I lived in Marysville until I graduated from Lindhurst H.S. After H.S., I was off to
              CSU Sacramento where I obtained a B.S. in Communication Studies. Coming from an agricultural, migrant background, my parents did 
              not have the means to pay for my college education so I put myself through school by working in the fields during summer break and
              then by working as a student assistant. While in college, I experienced my first major success in life. I was able to travel
              abroad and live in Sweden as an international student for one year. One of the most rewarding experiences! I knew then that
              anything was possible. I felt very proud to live in a different culture and to be able to adapt so well. The highlight of my 
              year abroad was traveling to St. Petersburg, Russia. I enjoy being a Realtor because I love working closely with individuals
              and learning about their goals and dreams of home ownership. I am excited to assist individuals in attaining their goal of
              homeownership. The most important thing to know is, I am professional and I seek education in order to stay current on an 
              ever changing Real Estate market. I would of never expect to be given your business because of our relationship, or how we
              may know each other. However, if you ever have a residential real estate need, I would be extremely honored if you would 
              give me an opportunity to work hard for you to earn your business. Thank you so much for taking the time read a little 
              about me. It is appreciated.
